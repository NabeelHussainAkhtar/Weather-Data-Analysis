Some examples of commands used in these projects are :

* head() - It shows the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5).

* shape - It shows the total no. of rows and no. of columns of the dataframe

* index - This attribute provides the index of the dataframe

* columns - It shows the name of each column

* dtypes - It shows the data-type of each column

* unique() - In a column, it shows all the unique values. It can be applied on a single column only, not on the whole dataframe.

* nunique() - It shows the total no. of unique values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole dataframe.

* count - It shows the total no. of non-null values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole dataframe.

* value_counts - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count. It can be applied on a single column only.

* info() - Provides basic information about the dataframe.* size - To show No. of total values(elements) in the dataset.

* duplicated( ) - To check row wise and detect the Duplicate rows.

* isnull( ) - To show where Null value is present.

* dropna( ) - It drops the rows that contains all missing values.

* isin( ) - To show all records including particular elements.

* str.contains( ) - To get all records that contains a given string.

* str.split( ) - It splits a column's string into different columns.

* to_datetime( ) - Converts the data-type of Date-Time Column into datetime[ns] datatype.

* dt.year.value_counts( ) - It counts the occurrence of all individual years in Time column.

* groupby( ) - Groupby is used to split the data into groups based on some criteria.

* sns.countplot(df['Col_name']) - To show the count of all unique values of any column in the form of bar graph.

* max( ), min( ) - It shows the maximum/minimum value of the series

* mean( ) - It shows the mean value of the series.



Through these projects and commands, learners will not only acquire essential skills in data analysis but also gain a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and methodologies driving the field of data analytics.
